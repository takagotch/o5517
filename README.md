# Job Scanner

This is a simple [Node.js][node] application that fetches job listings from different sources, saves the entries to a JSON file and sends email notifications for entries that match custom keywords. The goal is to help find small freelance jobs that get posted on sites like [Craigslist][craigslist], [Reddit][reddit], etc.

Email notifications are sent using the [Mailgun API][mailgun], so you will need to have an account there and configure your credentials and email address to receive emails from the app.
